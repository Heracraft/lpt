      "I was walking with my friend Tom in the park. We saw a couple having a picnic under an oak tree. They seemed to be enjoying themselves. We stopped to watch them, and they invited us to join them. We thanked them and accepted the offer. They had some sandwiches, drinks, and fruits. We talked about what had happened during the week and shared some stories. Then we started a game of catch using a Frisbee. It was exciting and fun. The sun was setting and the leaves were dropping from the tree. We kept playing until it was time to go home. We said goodbye and promised to meet again soon.",
